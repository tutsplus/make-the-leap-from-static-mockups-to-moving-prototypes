### Envato Tuts+ Course: Make the Leap: From Static Mockups to Moving Prototypes
#### Instructor: Chris O’Sullivan

If you don’t already use prototyping in your work, you might use flat mockups or flow diagrams to imagine how users will interact with your app. Getting started with prototyping can seem quite intimidating, especially with new tools becoming available all the time. But don’t fear! I’m going to show you how to quickly get started. By the end of this short course I’ll show you how with prototyping you can 

- start thinking about your work interactively
- communicate ideas to your team
- and test your designs with users

We’ll use two tool that are easy to get started with; Invision and Principle. You’ll get tonnes of value for only a short time investment.
